`<USER_SUMMARY> Minh is working on a personal project named ORCHID-27, for which they prefer Python. For the company project BLUEBIRD-42, the backend must use TypeScript with NestJS. They are also debugging async HTTP requests for ORCHID-27, with connection churn identified as the main issue. A task exists to complete the benchmark report, LAB-REPORT-1600, by Friday at 16:00. The effective solution for ASYNC-FIX-20 involves reusing the aiohttp ClientSession and setting concurrency to 20.  Minh prefers Python for personal projects like ORCHID-27 but dislikes Java.
